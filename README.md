# kilt-extension

KILT Extension helper functions. The tools you need to add a KILT extension to your app, or add KILT functionality to your extension.

## Get Extension

In order to use the extension with KILT credential API the extension needs to be injected into the application close to the loading of the application. Here you can use `getExtensions` function to add it directly to the application and wait for its response.

Now you can access the extensions API and handle the data and interactions between the Dapp and Extension.

See the `react-example.ts` example inside the get extension folder, here is how you can use `getExtensions` in a react app?

## Inject Extension

Currently work in progress.
